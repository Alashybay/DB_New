SQL:

Simple:
    SELECT * FROM books;

Intermediate:
    SELECT title, author, publication_date
    FROM books
    WHERE publication_date LIKE '2021%';

Complex:
    SELECT b.title, b.author, bo.name
    FROM books b
    JOIN borrowing_history bh ON b.book_id = bh.book_id
    JOIN borrowers bo ON bo.borrower_id = bh.borrower_id
    WHERE DATE_FORMAT(bh.borrow_date, '%Y') = '2023';

Advanced:
    SELECT b.title, b.author, COUNT(*) AS total_borrows
    FROM books b
    JOIN borrowing_history bh ON b.book_id = bh.book_id
    JOIN borrowers bo ON bo.borrower_id = bh.borrower_id
    WHERE YEAR(bh.borrow_date) = 2022
    GROUP BY b.title, b.author
    HAVING COUNT(*) > (
        SELECT AVG(borrows_per_book)
        FROM (
            SELECT COUNT(*) AS borrows_per_book
            FROM books b
            JOIN borrowing_history bh ON b.book_id = bh.book_id
            JOIN borrowers bo ON bo.borrower_id = bh.borrower_id
            WHERE YEAR(bh.borrow_date) = 2022
            GROUP BY b.title, b.author
        ) AS subquery
    )
    ORDER BY total_borrows DESC;
